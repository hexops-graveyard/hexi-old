# Contributing

## License Notice

By contributing to this repository in any form, you agree that your
contributions are dual-licensed under the MIT and Apache 2.0 licenses (see the
LICENSE-MIT and LICENSE-APACHE files, respectively). You agree to license your
code, and any relevant patents, under both of those licenses.

You will receive attribution for your changes via the Git commit history, which
shows exactly what you committed and when. We do not use an AUTHORS file or
similar, as it can become quickly out of date and is a tall burden for first
time contributors.

## General Rules

1. We care about code and project quality first and foremost.
	- It is possible and even likely that we will critique your changes
	  significantly, do not be discouraged by this.

2. When it doubt, talk it out.
	- If you have doubts about something being the right approach, or doubts
	  about your change not being accepted, create an issue and discuss it
	  with us first.
	- Creating a pull request without prior discussion for anything non-trivial
	  can often lead to us being unable to accept the change quickly, which can
	  unfortunately be very discouraging.
